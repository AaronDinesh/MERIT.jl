\section*{Risks and Mitigations}
As with any project, there are numerous risks with varying severities that can impact the timeline of the project and the quality of the end result. A good project plan not only identifies and quantifies the risks, but also includes mitigations that can reduce the impact of these risks. These risks are graded on a 5-point scale with the likelihood values being Rare, Unlikely, Moderate, Likely and Certain (1-5 respectively). The impact is also graded on a 5-point scale with the values being Insignificant, Minor, Significant, Major and Severe (1-5 respectively). The product of the severity and likelihood values produces a risk score that can be used to determine how impactful a particular risk can be if it occurs and is not handled appropriately\\

    \hline
    Missing deadlines & 3 & 2 & \cellcolor{Medium} 6 & Generous deadlines and inclusion of 14 days of slack at the end \\
    \hline
    Failing to implement beamformers & 3 & 1 & \cellcolor{VeryLow} 3 & There are plenty of resources and reference implementations available online \\
    \hline
    Failing to run the code on the GPU & 2 & 3 & \cellcolor{Medium} 6 & There are many workshops online that demonstrate how to write performant Julia code for GPUs \\
    \hline
    Don't have enough time to perform End-to-End Testing & 4 & 2 & \cellcolor{Medium} 8 & Perform testing as the code is being written. So that at the end only minimal testing is required \\
    \hline
    Don't get the final report done in time & 5 & 2 & \cellcolor{High} 10 & The slack days included means that I should still have time to write the report even if deadlines slip \\
    \hline
    Fail to implement the Type Hierarchy & 4 & 3 & \cellcolor{High} 12 & Conceptually establish the type hierarchy early on in the development process. Look at other libraries that have had to implement a similar hierarchy and consider how they achieved it \\
