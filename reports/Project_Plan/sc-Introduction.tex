\section*{Introduction}
Microwave imaging has started to garner an interest amongst the medical community as an alternative and safer form of imaging when compared to more traditional methods such as X-rays. Recent clinical trials such as the “MARIA M4” system have proven that such microwave based methods are more comfortable and offer a viable alternative to X-rays \cite{RN1}. Mammography is not the only area where this imaging modality is being trialled. It is seeing use in areas such as traumatic brain injury detection, bone degradation, and tumour detection \cite{RN2}. As such there needs to be a robust and easy to use software framework that will allow these systems to be programmed and their data to be analysed.
