\section*{Goals and Objectives}
The goal of this library is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a comprehensive and easy to use microwave imaging library
    \item Create a data structure and a type-heirarchy that allow for easy extension and flexibility
    \item Code the functions to run on the GPU
    \item Publish the library to the Julia packages repository \\
\end{itemize}
The stretch goals for this project include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extending the functionality past what the MATLAB library offers
    \item Implementing more signal processing algorithms for microwave imaging \\
\end{itemize}
