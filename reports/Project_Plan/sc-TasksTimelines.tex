\noindent
The above table outlines the tasks and their deadlines that need to be completed in order for the
project and the library to be considered a success. The deadlines set were generous to account for any
unforeseen events that may arise that would cause the project to slip. While the probability for such
an event occurring is low, measures must still be put in place to safeguard the project in the unlikely
event that a delay occurs. As well as generous deadlines, I also have included 14 days of slack at the
end, assuming a deadline of April 12, 2024. This again was to account for any unforeseen
complications that may arise during development.
